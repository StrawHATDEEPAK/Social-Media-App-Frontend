# Social Media App ðŸ“±

### Overview
This is a **social media application** developed using **Flutter**. The app allows users to sign up, create profiles, post updates, share stories, follow other users, engage in social interactions (liking, commenting, chatting), and more. This project showcases my proficiency in **Flutter**, **Firebase (or another backend)**, and building modern, feature-rich apps.

### Features
- **User Authentication**: Sign up and log in using email and password.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their personal details and profile picture.
- **Post Creation**: Users can create posts with text and images.
- **News Feed**: A scrollable feed displaying posts from people the user follows.
- **Stories**: Users can post short, time-sensitive content (images, videos) that disappear after 24 hours.
- **Follow System**: Users can follow/unfollow other users.
- **Likes and Comments**: Interact with posts by liking or commenting on them.
- **Direct Messaging (Chat)**: Real-time 1-on-1 chat with other users.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Users receive updates when someone likes, comments, or sends a message.
